    <h2>What is Web Development?</h2>

<p><q>Website development is a catch-all term for the work that goes into building a website. This includes 
everything from markup and coding to scripting, network configuration, and <i title="Content Management System">
CMS</i> development.</q>
<br />
While web development typically refers to web markup and coding, website development includes all related 
development tasks, such as client-side scripting, server-side scripting, server and network security
configuration, eCommerce development, and <i title="Content Management System">CMS</i> development. 
</p>
<h2>Why is Web Development important?</h2>
<p>The Internet isn’t going anywhere. In fact, it’s become a portal and primary method of research, connection,
education, and entertainment in the world. As of 2021, there were <b>4.66 billion global Internet users</b>
 — more than half the world’s population.
<br>
Given the rapidly-increasing number of Internet users, it’s no surprise that web development is a rapidly 
expanding industry. Between now and 2030, the employment of web developers is expected to <b>grow by 13%</b>,
 much faster than most other technology careers.
